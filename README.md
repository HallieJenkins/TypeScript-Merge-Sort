# TypeScript Merge Sort
The program takes the name of a comma-delimited text file (CSV) and a number as input on the command line, sorts the
file by the field indicated by that integer and prints the file.

## Setup
The TypeScript file will be compiled using `tsc`

The JavaScript program will be run using `node.js`


## Running

From the command line:

```
tsc assignment2.ts
node assignment2.js SampleFile_A2.txt [number from 0-3]
```
